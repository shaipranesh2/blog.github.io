            <p>Hello everyone, I will spending this summer contributing to Red Hen labs under the Google Summer of Code 2023 program.
This project aims to improve on the previous year work on "Classification of body-keypoint trajectories
of gesture co-occurring with time expressions" by proposing a Graph neural networks to better exploit
the datasetâ€™s nature and using fusion techniques to combine the keypose and audio data to tackle the
performance problems faced last year. For more details, refer this <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/989BTxO8">link.</a>
Stay tuned for more updates!!</p>
